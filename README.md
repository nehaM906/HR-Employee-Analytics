HR Analytics ‚Äì Exploratory Data Analysis on Employee Attrition
This project presents an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) on HR data, specifically focusing on employee attrition. The goal is to identify patterns and factors that contribute to employees leaving an organization, using data-driven insights to support strategic HR decisions.

The dataset includes employee-level information such as age, department, job role, income, marital status, overtime status, years at the company, and more. The analysis is performed using a combination of SQL for querying, Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib) for data manipulation and visualization, and optionally Excel or Power BI for dashboarding.

Key analyses performed in this project include:

Attrition count by department and gender

Attrition trends across job roles and income levels

The relationship between overtime and attrition

Impact of years at company and age on employee turnover

Attrition rate segmented by education field and marital status

Each of these analyses is visualized using Python, allowing for clear and impactful storytelling. Charts such as bar plots, line graphs, and stacked visualizations were used to convey attrition trends effectively. SQL queries were embedded within the Jupyter Notebook using SQLite to extract key summaries before visualizing them.

üîç Key Findings:
Employees working overtime are significantly more likely to leave.

Younger employees, especially those aged 18‚Äì25, have the highest attrition rate.

Attrition is highest among employees with less than 3 years at the company.

Roles like Sales Executive and Laboratory Technician showed both lower average income and higher attrition.
